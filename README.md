**Emb4_4x5Mosaic_2CAMs_595GB (318 GB compressed)**
Mouse embryo head, 4 columns x 5 rows mosaic, 2 camera views, dividing nuclei in PH3-A488 fluorescence channel. The 3D tiles are stored as series of 2D TIFF files. The original dataset is 1.19 TB in size (2 fluorescence channels).
Note: should be opened with Dual camera ticked in MosaicExplorerJ to browse both camera views.

**Brain2_izq_2x8Mosaic_LeftSide_300GB (180 GB compressed)**
Mouse brain, left illumination side (2 columns x 8 rows mosaic), Blood vessels in Tomato-Lectin fluorescence channel. The 2D tiles are stored as 3D TIFF images. The original dataset is 1.2 TB (2 sides and 2 fluorescent channels).

**Emb3_2x2_Mosaic_2CAMs_12GB (8 GB compressed)**
Mouse embryo head, 3D cropped out volume from the complete scan (4 columns x 4 rows), 2 columns x 2 rows mosaic, 2 camera views, dividing nuclei in PH3-A488 fluorescence channel. The 3D tiles are stored as series of 2D TIFF files. The original dataset is 866 GB in size (2 fluorescence channels).
Note: should be opened with Dual camera ticked in MosaicExplorerJ to browse both camera views.
